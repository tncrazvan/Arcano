/**
 * ElkServer is a Java library that makes it easier
 * to program and manage a Java servlet by providing different tools
 * such as:
 * 1) An MVC (Model-View-Controller) alike design pattern to manage 
 *    client requests without using any URL rewriting rules.
 * 2) A WebSocket Manager, allowing the server to accept and manage 
 *    incoming WebSocket connections.
 * 3) Direct access to every socket bound to every client application.
 * 4) Direct access to the headers of the incomming and outgoing Http messages.
